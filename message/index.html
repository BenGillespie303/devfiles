	<h2>Fashion, Masculinity, and Perfection of the Male Form</h2></header>
	<main> <h2>The Jort Manifesto </h2><h4>"Half jean, half short. Fully torqued".</h4><p>For years, male jorts have allowed men of all ages to quickly and economically free their thighs for generations. Free of femoral obstruction, jort-wearing men have been able to perfect male fashion. No longer are the quads of humanity shackled by excess denim, but rather accelerated into a new era of comfort and flexibility.</p><p>Contemporary jorts made their way to America in the 70s. Fueled by marijuana cigarettes and LSD, a group of artistic visionaries brought the male leg into the public eye. By cutting the pant leg well above the knee and slightly below the crotch, the early adopters of the Jort exposed the leg and reinvented the way society viewed the male form.</p>
		<p>After America went through a brief phase of baggy basketball shorts and shorts with unnecessary pockets, the Jort emerged from the darkness with incredible ferver. Jorts soon became a staple in American media, sported by legends such as Chuck Norris, Danny McBride, and David Beckham. The look quickly seeped into contemporary college culture. Fueled by social media addiction and inflated egos, jorts quickly became popular amongst the popular kids. 
</p>
<p>Great things happen when people acknowledge the conventions presented, but choose to create their own way of life. Donâ€™t be afraid to show some skin.
