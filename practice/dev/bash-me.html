		<h2>Biography</h2>
		<p>My name is Ben. I am a Technology, Arts, and Media major with interests
		mostly in filmmaking and photography. I am also interested in web design 
		because it seems pretty neat. I'm a big fan of awwwards.com and find it really
		inspiring and entertaining.</p>
<p>I am interested in learning how to make more 
		engaging and impressive websites. I did a little bit of parallax scrolling stuff in
		my final portfolio for web class, and I thought it looked super cool so I would
		love to do more stuff like that. I also have seen a few websites that manipulate 
		3 dimensional space in an engaging way, which would be interesting to learn as
		well. </p>
